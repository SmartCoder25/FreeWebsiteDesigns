I'll help you create the project directory structure and build the frontend first. Let me start by creating a complete React frontend with the form you specified.I've created a complete frontend for your Scalable Local Web App! Here's what I've built:

## 🎯 **Frontend Features Implemented**

### **Form with 4 Required Fields:**
1. **Service Name** - Text input for the service to optimize
2. **Parameter to Optimize** - Text input (e.g., response_time, cpu_usage, memory)  
3. **Duration in Days** - Number input for analysis period

### **Key Frontend Components:**

**🔹 ServiceForm Component:**
- Form validation with error messages
- Loading states with spinner animation
- Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS

**🔹 OptimizationGraph Component:**
- Built with Recharts for data visualization
- Responsive line chart for showing optimization results
- Empty state when no data is available

**🔹 API Service:**
- Axios integration ready for backend connection
- Error handling for API failures
- Configurable base URL (currently set to `http://localhost:8000`)

### **🎨 UI/UX Features:**
- **Modern gradient background** and glassmorphism effects
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes
- **Form validation** with real-time error feedback
- **Loading states** with professional animations
- **Success/Error notifications** for user feedback
- **Mock data simulation** for demo purposes

### **📁 Project Structure (Frontend)**
```
frontend/
├── index.html (Single-page React app)
├── Components:
│   ├── ServiceForm (Form handling)
│   ├── OptimizationGraph (Data visualization)
│   └── App (Main component)
├── Services:
│   └── apiService (API integration)
```

### **🔧 Tech Stack Used:**
- **React 18** (with hooks: useState, useEffect)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Axios** for API requests
- **Recharts** for graph plotting
- **Form validation** built-in

### **🚀 Ready for Backend Integration:**
The frontend is configured to connect to your FastAPI backend at `http://localhost:8000/api/process`. Once you build the backend following your plan, simply uncomment the actual API call in the `handleFormSubmit` function.

The form is now ready to collect the optimization parameters and display results in a beautiful, interactive graph! Would you like me to help you create the backend FastAPI structure next?
